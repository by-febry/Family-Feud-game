Game Rules and Mechanics
Objective
Players aim to guess the most popular answers to survey questions to earn points for their teams.

Team Setup
Teams: Two teams (Team A and Team B) compete against each other.
Team Names: Each team can set a name before starting the game, which will be displayed throughout the game.
Game Structure
Game Start:

Each team takes turns guessing answers to questions.
A timer is set for each round (e.g., 30 seconds).
Questions and Answers:

The game consists of a series of questions with multiple answers.
Each answer has a corresponding point value based on its popularity.
Questions can vary in theme (e.g., pop culture, everyday life).
Answer Submission:

Teams submit their answers via an input form.
If a team provides a correct answer, they score points based on the answer's value.
If the answer is incorrect, the turn passes to the opposing team.
Scoring:

Points are accumulated for each correct answer.
At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.
Optional: Implement a "bonus round" where teams can double their points for a correct answer.
Game End:

The game ends when all questions have been answered or after a predetermined number of rounds.
The team with the highest score is declared the winner.
Game Flow
Teams are introduced, and names are displayed.
The first question is presented to Team A.
Team A submits an answer within the time limit.
If correct: points are added, and the next question is shown.
If incorrect: the turn passes to Team B.
The process repeats until all questions are exhausted.
Final scores are displayed, and a winner is announced.


The HTML structure of the "Spree" store's order management interface effectively organizes and presents information, utilizing elements like tables for order details and semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, and <footer> for clarity and accessibility. However, an enhancement could involve replacing generic <div> elements with more specific semantic elements like <section> to delineate distinct parts of the interface, such as order summary and customer information. This change would improve accessibility for screen readers and enhance SEO by providing clearer context about the content's purpose and organization.

In the web system, JavaScript was implemented to manage user interactions by utilizing event listeners to trigger actions such as submitting forms, updating the order status, and dynamically modifying content without reloading the page. This approach enhances user experience by providing real-time feedback and a smoother interface. One suggested enhancement could be the introduction of a modal confirmation dialog before critical actions, such as deleting an order or making a payment. This would prevent accidental actions and allow users to review their choices, ultimately improving usability and user satisfaction.

In the web system, PHP was utilized to manage order data by processing form submissions, querying the MySQL database to retrieve existing order information, and executing insert or update operations based on user actions. PHPâ€™s integration with MySQL allowed for efficient data manipulation, enabling dynamic interactions such as displaying order summaries and managing order statuses. One improvement for the PHP implementation could be the adoption of prepared statements for database queries. This enhancement would not only bolster security against SQL injection attacks but also optimize performance by allowing the database to cache execution plans for repeated queries.
