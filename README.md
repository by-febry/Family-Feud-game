Game Rules and Mechanics
Objective
Players aim to guess the most popular answers to survey questions to earn points for their teams.

Team Setup
Teams: Two teams (Team A and Team B) compete against each other.
Team Names: Each team can set a name before starting the game, which will be displayed throughout the game.
Game Structure
Game Start:

Each team takes turns guessing answers to questions.
A timer is set for each round (e.g., 30 seconds).
Questions and Answers:

The game consists of a series of questions with multiple answers.
Each answer has a corresponding point value based on its popularity.
Questions can vary in theme (e.g., pop culture, everyday life).
Answer Submission:

Teams submit their answers via an input form.
If a team provides a correct answer, they score points based on the answer's value.
If the answer is incorrect, the turn passes to the opposing team.
Scoring:

Points are accumulated for each correct answer.
At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.
Optional: Implement a "bonus round" where teams can double their points for a correct answer.
Game End:

The game ends when all questions have been answered or after a predetermined number of rounds.
The team with the highest score is declared the winner.
Game Flow
Teams are introduced, and names are displayed.
The first question is presented to Team A.
Team A submits an answer within the time limit.
If correct: points are added, and the next question is shown.
If incorrect: the turn passes to Team B.
The process repeats until all questions are exhausted.
Final scores are displayed, and a winner is announced.
